I developed a machine learning project using Python, where I trained a cancer prediction model with an accuracy of 93%. This project involved extensive preprocessing of data, meticulous training of the model, and thorough evaluation to ensure its reliability. Through this process, I demonstrated my proficiency in Python programming and my expertise in machine learning methodologies.
